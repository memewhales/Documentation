## Reward Calculation

### Creator Fee Breakdown

When someone trades your token:

```
Trading Fee: 5% of trade value

Distribution:
→ ~40% to Creator (You)
→ ~40% to Early Birds (20 holders, split equally)
→ ~20% to Treasury (Platform operations & buybacks)
```

**Example**:
```
Trade: 10 SOL buy order
Fee: 0.5 SOL (5%)
Your Earnings: ~0.2 SOL
Early Bird Pool: ~0.2 SOL (0.01 SOL each)
Treasury: ~0.1 SOL
```

### Early Bird Reward Calculation

Your Early Bird earnings per trade:

```
Early Bird Share = (Trading Fee × 40%) ÷ 20 seats

Example:
Trading Fee: 0.5 SOL
Early Bird Pool: 0.2 SOL (40% of fee)
Your Share: 0.01 SOL (1/20th of pool)
```

**Volume Matters**:
```
Daily Volume: 100 SOL
Daily Fees: 5 SOL
Early Bird Pool: 2 SOL
Your Daily Share: 0.1 SOL
Monthly Earnings: ~3 SOL
```

Scenario 2 (Efficient):
Claim 0.3 SOL monthly
Gas: 0.0001 SOL
