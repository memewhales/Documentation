## 💰 How Platform Fees Power $YOINK

Every transaction on Yoink generates a **4% fee**. Here's where it goes:

| Fee Component | Percentage | Destination |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Platform Fee | **1%** | Split 50-50 |
| → Platform Treasury | 0.5% | Operations & Development |
| → **$YOINK Buyback** | **0.5%** | **Buys $YOINK from market** 🔥 |
| Creator Fee | 0.8% | Token creator |
| Early Bird Pool | 1.2% | First 20 holders |
| Treasury | 1% | Token-specific buybacks |

### 🔄 The Flywheel in Action

**For every transaction on the platform, 0.5% automatically buys $YOINK.**

- $100K daily volume → $500 buys $YOINK
- $1M daily volume → $5,000 buys $YOINK
- $10M daily volume → $50,000 buys $YOINK

**More platform volume = More $YOINK buybacks = Stronger ecosystem**

## 🎓 Bonus: Token Graduation Treasury

{% hint style="info" %}
### 💎 Extra Buyback Mechanism

When a token graduates from the bonding curve to Raydium, any **remaining treasury balance** (originally used for that token's buybacks) is also used to **buyback $YOINK**.

This means successful token graduations create additional $YOINK buying pressure beyond the standard platform fees.

**Result:** Every token's success directly benefits $YOINK holders. 🚀
