# 🚀 How $YOINK Launched

## The Evolution of Creator Capital Markets

**The internet finally has a market for attention.**

Yoink is a next-generation **virality capital markets platform** on Solana. We're not another memecoin launchpad—we're the evolution of Creator Capital Markets (CCM), transforming viral moments into liquid, tradable assets.

## What Makes Yoink Different

Yoink is a creator-first protocol where:

### 🎯 Trade Creators
Speculate on who's going viral next, or support your favorite streamers. Each token represents a real creator and their viral potential.

### 💰 Reward Creators
Verified streamers claim a cut of trading fees directly from their token's volume. Real earnings, real incentives.

### 🔄 Buyback Engine
Each token builds its own treasury that automatically buys back and burns when price drops below EMA. Built-in price support.

### 🐦 Early Bird Bonus
The first 20 holders of any token share a reward pool funded by trading volume. Sell and you lose your seat—incentivizing true early supporters.

## The $YOINK Flywheel

Every trade on the platform fuels a powerful cycle:

```
Virality → Volume → Creator Rewards → Token Buybacks → $YOINK Buybacks
```

**We capture the value of attention itself.** Every viral moment, every clip, every creator—forever tradable, forever valuable.

## Why We Launched on Pump.fun

{% hint style="info" %}
**Strategic Launch Decision**

We launched $YOINK on **pump.fun** first—the current epicenter of attention and liquidity in the Solana ecosystem.

**Why?**
- **Capture Mainstream Eyes**: Pump.fun has the eyeballs. Launching there meant instant visibility to the exact audience we're building for.
- **Prove the Concept**: Before asking people to use our platform, we showed them we understand how to build attention-driven markets.
- **Bootstrap Community**: Meet traders where they are, build trust, then invite them to experience the next evolution.
- **Fair Launch**: No VC allocation, no insider rounds—pure community-driven from day one.

**The Strategy**: Launch where attention lives → Build community → Onboard to our platform → Grow together.

We practiced what we preach: **virality first, everything else follows.**
