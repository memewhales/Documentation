## What You'll Need

2. Click the **"Connect"** button in the top right
3. Choose your preferred login method

**Tip**: If you're new to crypto, we recommend using email or social login - Privy will automatically create a secure embedded wallet for you! Make sure you have at least 0.1 SOL for trading fees and transactions.

## Security Best Practices

### Keep Your Wallet Safe:

* Never share your seed phrase with anyone
* Always verify you're on the correct website (yoink.now)
* Use hardware wallets for large amounts
* Be cautious of phishing attempts

### Disconnecting Your Wallet

To disconnect your wallet:

1. Click your wallet address in the top right
2. Select "Disconnect" from the menu
3. Your wallet will be disconnected immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If you're having trouble connecting:

* Refresh the page and try again
* Clear your browser cache
* Update your wallet extension to the latest version
* Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Wrong Network

Make sure your wallet is set to Solana Mainnet. Yoink operates on Solana mainnet, not devnet or testnet.

### Transaction Errors

If transactions fail:

* Ensure you have enough SOL for transaction fees (0.001-0.01 SOL)
* Check your wallet is properly connected
* Wait a few seconds and try again
