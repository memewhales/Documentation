# Connect Your Wallet

Learn how to connect your Solana wallet to Yoink and start trading creator tokens.

## Supported Wallets

Yoink supports all major Solana wallets through Privy authentication:

* **Phantom** (Recommended)
* **Solflare**
* **Backpack**
* **Coinbase Wallet**
* **And many more...**

## Connection Process

### 1. Click Connect Wallet

Navigate to [yoink.now](https://yoink.now) and click the **"Connect Wallet"** button in the top right corner.

### 2. Select Your Wallet

A modal will appear showing all available wallet options. Select your preferred wallet.

**New to Solana?** We recommend [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) for beginners - it's easy to use and widely supported.

### 3. Approve Connection

Your wallet will open and ask you to approve the connection. Review the permissions and click **"Approve"** or **"Connect"**.

### 4. Sign Message

You may be asked to sign a message to verify wallet ownership. This doesn't cost any gas and is used for security purposes.

## What Happens After Connection?

Once connected, you'll be able to:

* ✅ Browse and search creator tokens
* ✅ Buy and sell tokens
* ✅ View your portfolio
* ✅ Track your Early Bird status
* ✅ Claim rewards (if you're a creator)

## Security Best Practices

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Keep Your Wallet Safe**:
* Never share your seed phrase with anyone
* Always verify you're on the correct website (yoink.now)
* Use hardware wallets for large amounts
* Be cautious of phishing attempts

## Disconnecting Your Wallet

To disconnect your wallet:

1. Click your wallet address in the top right
2. Select **"Disconnect"** from the menu
3. Your wallet will be disconnected immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. **Refresh the page** and try again
2. **Clear your browser cache**
3. **Update your wallet extension** to the latest version
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome recommended)

### Wrong Network

Make sure your wallet is set to **Solana Mainnet**. Yoink operates on Solana mainnet, not devnet or testnet.

### Transaction Errors

If transactions fail:

* Ensure you have enough SOL for transaction fees (0.001-0.01 SOL)
* Check your wallet is properly connected
* Wait a few seconds and try again
