## Trading Tips

### Timing Your Buy

**Best Times to Buy**:

* 🌅 Before creator goes live
* 📉 After price dips below EMA (buyback imminent)
* 🔥 During low volatility periods
* 📊 When volume is moderate

**Avoid Buying**:

* 🚀 During massive pumps (FOMO)

### Position Sizing

Start small and scale:

* **First Purchase**: 0.1-0.5 SOL to test
* **Small Position**: 0.5-2 SOL
* **Medium Position**: 2-5 SOL
* **Large Position**: 5+ SOL (experienced traders)

### Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)

Instead of buying all at once:

* Split purchase into multiple smaller buys
* Buy at different price levels
