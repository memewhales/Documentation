## Before You Sell

### Important Considerations

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Early Bird Warning**: If you're an Early Bird, selling ANY amount will PERMANENTLY forfeit your seat and all future rewards!
{% endhint %}

Ask yourself:

* Are you an Early Bird? (Check your profile)
* Have you achieved your profit target?
* Is this the right time to exit?
* Do you understand tax implications?

### When to Consider Selling

**Good Reasons**:

* ✅ Reached profit target
* ✅ Need liquidity for other opportunities
* ✅ Token fundamentals changed
* ✅ Risk management (taking profits)
* ✅ Portfolio rebalancing

**Bad Reasons**:

* ❌ Panic selling on small dip
* ❌ FOMO into another token
* ❌ Emotional reaction to FUD
* ❌ Impatience during consolidation

## Step-by-Step Selling Guide

### 1. Access Your Token

Navigate to the token you want to sell:

* Go to your **Profile**
* View your **Holdings**
* Click on the token card
* Or search for token directly

### 2. Open Sell Widget

On the token page:

1. Locate the **Buy/Sell widget**
2. Click the **"Sell"** tab
3. Widget shows your token balance

### 3. Enter Amount to Sell

Choose how much to sell:

#### Option A: Enter Token Amount

* Type the number of tokens to sell
* Widget calculates SOL you'll receive

#### Option B: Use Percentage Buttons

* **25%**: Sell quarter of your holdings
* **50%**: Sell half position
* **75%**: Sell three-quarters
* **100%**: Exit entire position (WARNING: Loses Early Bird)

#### Option C: Enter SOL Amount

* Specify SOL amount you want to receive
* Widget calculates tokens needed

### 4. Review Sell Details

The widget displays:

| Detail | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **You Sell** | Token amount being sold |
| **You Receive** | SOL you'll get (estimated) |
| **Price Impact** | How your sale affects price |
| **Slippage Tolerance** | Max acceptable price change |
| **Trading Fee** | Platform fees (from received SOL) |
| **Minimum Received** | Worst-case SOL amount |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Price Impact**: Selling large amounts can significantly drop the price. Consider selling in batches for better execution.
{% endhint %}

### 5. Adjust Slippage (If Needed)

For sell orders:

* **Standard**: 1-2% slippage
* **Large Orders**: 3-10% slippage
* **Volatile Tokens**: 5-15% slippage
* **Low Liquidity**: May need higher slippage

### 6. Confirm Sale

1. Review all details carefully
2. **Final Warning**: Check Early Bird status
3. Click **"Sell"** button
4. Confirm transaction in wallet
5. Approve the transaction
6. Wait for confirmation

### 7. Transaction Complete

After confirmation:

* ✅ SOL deposited to your wallet
* ✅ Tokens removed from balance
* ✅ Transaction recorded in history
* ⚠️ Early Bird status lost (if applicable)

## Early Bird Implications

### Before Selling as Early Bird

{% hint style="danger" %}
**READ THIS CAREFULLY**:
* Selling = Permanent loss of Early Bird seat
* No way to get seat back
* Forfeit ALL future rewards
* Even selling 1 token triggers this
{% endhint %}

### Calculate Opportunity Cost

Before selling, compare:

**Immediate Profit** vs **Future Early Bird Rewards**

Example calculation:
```
Current Profit: 2 SOL
Future Monthly Rewards: 0.5 SOL
Holding Period for Break-even: 4 months

Question: Is 2 SOL now worth more than 
0.5 SOL/month indefinitely?
```

### Alternative to Selling

If you're an Early Bird but need liquidity:

* **Borrow against** position (if platform offers)
* **Sell other holdings** instead
* **Buy more** of different tokens
* **Wait** for larger price target
* **Accumulate more rewards** before deciding

## Selling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Profit Taking

**Ladder Out Approach**:

* Sell 25% at 2x gain
* Sell 25% at 5x gain
* Sell 25% at 10x gain
* Hold 25% as "moon bag"

### Strategy 2: Risk Management

**Stop Loss Strategy**:

* Set price target for exit
* Sell if price drops below level
* Protects capital
* Removes emotion

### Strategy 3: Rebalancing

**Portfolio Rebalancing**:

* Token becomes too large % of portfolio
* Sell portion to rebalance
* Maintain diversification
* Manage overall risk

### Strategy 4: Event-Based

**Sell on Specific Events**:

* Creator stops streaming
* Token graduates to DEX (optional exit)
* Fundamentals change
* Better opportunity elsewhere

## Optimal Selling Times

### Best Times to Sell

## Managing Large Positions

### For Big Holdings

If selling large position:

1. **Split the Sale**: Multiple smaller sells
2. **Time It**: Spread over hours/days
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch price reaction
4. **Adjust Strategy**: Based on market depth

### Example: Selling 1M Tokens

Instead of selling all at once:

* Day 1: Sell 250k tokens
* Day 2: Sell 250k tokens  
* Day 3: Sell 250k tokens
* Day 4: Sell remaining 250k tokens

**Benefits**:

* Better average exit price
* Maintains market stability
* Allows others to buy dips

2. **Record Transaction**: Save hash and details
3. **Update Tracking**: Log exit price and profit
4. **Tax Documentation**: Record for reporting

### Profit Management

What to do with proceeds:

* **Reinvest**: Into other tokens
* **Hold SOL**: Wait for opportunities
* **Take Profits**: Withdraw some gains
* **Diversify**: Spread across different assets

### Tax Reporting
