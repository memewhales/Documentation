# Early Bird Bonus

The Early Bird Bonus is a revolutionary mechanic that rewards the first 20 holders of each token who demonstrate diamond hands by not selling.

## What is the Early Bird Bonus?

The Early Bird pool is a **first-of-its-kind reward mechanism** that:

* Collects a percentage of all trading volume for the token
* Distributes rewards among the first 20 buyers who haven't sold
* Rewards loyalty and early belief in creators
* Creates a strong holder base from launch

{% hint style="success" %}
**Key Benefit**: Early Birds receive passive income from ALL trading activity, regardless of price movement!
{% endhint %}

## How It Works

### 1. Earn Your Seat

To become an Early Bird:

1. Be among the **first 20 buyers** of a token
2. Complete your purchase transaction
3. Your seat is secured immediately

### 2. Keep Your Seat

To maintain Early Bird status:

* **Never sell** any amount of your tokens
* **Hold your position** indefinitely
* **Accumulate rewards** from trading volume

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Critical**: Selling even 1 token forfeits your Early Bird seat permanently! The seat CANNOT be reclaimed.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Earn Rewards

As an Early Bird, you earn:

* **Trading Fee Share**: Percentage of all buy/sell transactions
* **Proportional Distribution**: Rewards split based on your holding size
* **Continuous Income**: Earn as long as trading continues

## Reward Distribution

### How Rewards are Calculated

```
Your Early Bird Reward = (Your Holdings / Total Early Bird Holdings) × Early Bird Pool
```

**Example**:
* Early Bird Pool: 10 SOL
* Your holdings: 5% of all Early Bird holdings
* Your reward: 0.5 SOL

### When Rewards are Distributed

* Rewards accumulate in real-time
* Can be claimed at any time through your profile
* No minimum threshold required
* Gas fees apply when claiming

## Early Bird Dynamics

### Seat Forfeiture

When an Early Bird sells:

1. They **immediately lose** their Early Bird status
2. Their seat becomes **vacant** (not transferred)
3. Remaining Early Birds share rewards among fewer holders
4. **More rewards** for remaining Early Birds!

### Maximum Early Birds

* **20 seats total** per token
* Once filled, no new Early Birds possible
* Forfeited seats remain vacant
* This creates increasing value for remaining holders

## Strategy Tips

### For New Early Birds

1. **Act Fast**: Seats fill quickly on popular tokens
2. **Check Holdings**: Verify you're in top 20
3. **Never Sell**: Protect your status at all costs
4. **Accumulate**: Consider buying more (doesn't affect seat)

### Maximizing Returns

* **Choose Actively Traded Tokens**: More volume = more rewards
* **Support the Creator**: Help grow trading activity
* **Hold Long-term**: Rewards compound over time
* **Monitor Performance**: Track your earnings

### Risk Consideration

While Early Birds earn passive income, consider:

* Token price can still decrease
* Rewards may not offset price declines
* Illiquidity risk if you need to exit
* Choose tokens carefully

## Checking Your Status

### On Token Page

Each token page shows:

* Number of Early Bird seats filled (e.g., "15/20")
* Available seats remaining
* Your Early Bird status (if applicable)

### On Your Profile

Your profile displays:

* All tokens where you're an Early Bird
* Total rewards earned per token
* Claimable rewards
* Your ranking among Early Birds

## Early Bird Leaderboard

The platform features leaderboards showing:

* **Top Early Bird Earners**: Most rewards claimed
* **Longest Holders**: Early Birds by time held
* **Biggest Holdings**: Largest Early Bird positions

## Historical Examples

### Successful Early Birds

Tokens with high trading volume have generated significant Early Bird rewards:

* **Active Streamer Tokens**: Consistent trading during streams
* **Viral Moments**: Spike in activity around viral content
* **Community Tokens**: Strong holder bases maintain volume

## FAQs

### Can I buy more tokens after becoming an Early Bird?

Yes! Buying more tokens doesn't affect your Early Bird status. Your seat is secured and you can accumulate more.

### What if I accidentally sell?

Unfortunately, selling ANY amount immediately forfeits your Early Bird status forever. This is permanent and cannot be reversed. Use caution!

### Can I transfer tokens?

Transferring tokens counts as "selling" and will forfeit your Early Bird status. Keep tokens in your original wallet.

### What happens if token graduates to DEX?

Early Bird status and rewards continue even after token graduates to Raydium. The pool continues accumulating from DEX trading fees.

### How often should I claim rewards?

Claim whenever you want! Consider gas fees - it may be worth waiting until rewards are larger to minimize fee impact.
