# Trading Guide

Master the art of trading creator tokens on Yoink with this comprehensive guide.

## Understanding Creator Tokens

Each token on Yoink represents a creator's brand and community. When you trade these tokens, you're speculating on:

* Creator's growth and virality
* Trading volume and community engagement  
* Creator's content performance
* Market sentiment around the creator

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro Tip**: Tokens linked to active streamers with growing communities tend to have higher trading volume and more opportunities for profit.

## Trading Mechanics

### Bonding Curve

All new tokens start on a bonding curve that determines price based on supply:

* **Lower supply** = Lower price
* **Higher supply** = Higher price
* **Predictable pricing** until bonding curve completes

When a token reaches its market cap target (bonding curve completes), it automatically "graduates" to Raydium DEX with locked liquidity.

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Early Bird Strategy

The safest and most rewarding strategy for new tokens:

* **Be among the first 20 buyers** to become an Early Bird
* **Hold your position** to receive ongoing trading fee distributions
* **Accumulate rewards** as trading volume increases
* **Never sell** or you lose your Early Bird status permanently

### 2. Volume Trading

For active traders looking to profit from price movements:

* Monitor tokens with high trading volume
* Look for price dips below EMA (buyback triggers)
* Take advantage of volatility
* Set appropriate slippage for large trades

### 3. Creator Growth Play

Long-term strategy based on creator potential:

* Research the creator's content quality
* Check streaming schedule and consistency
* Monitor social media growth
* Look for creators with engaged communities

### 4. Live Stream Sniper

Target tokens when creators go live:

* Trading volume typically spikes during streams
* Price often increases with live viewers
* Early entry before stream start can be profitable
* Monitor the "Live" section for opportunities

## Reading the Charts

### TradingView Integration

Each token has a full TradingView chart showing:

* **Price action**: Candlestick charts with multiple timeframes
* **Volume**: Trading activity over time
* **Indicators**: EMA, volume bars, and more
* **Burn marks**: Visual indicators of buyback burns

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | What It Means | Trading Signal |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Market Cap** | Total value of all tokens | Higher = more established |
| **24h Volume** | Trading activity | Higher = more liquid |
| **Holders** | Number of wallets | More = better distribution |
| **Early Birds** | Available seats | < 20 = opportunity |
| **Buyback Treasury** | SOL available for buybacks | Higher = stronger floor |

## Risk Management

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: Only trade what you can afford to lose. Crypto trading is highly volatile.

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small positions to learn
2. **Diversify**: Don't put all funds in one token
3. **Set Limits**: Decide entry/exit points before trading
4. **DYOR**: Research creators before investing
5. **Monitor**: Keep track of your positions

### Red Flags

Be cautious of:

* ⚠️ Tokens with very few holders
* ⚠️ Creators with no verified socials
* ⚠️ Extremely low liquidity
* ⚠️ Suspicious trading patterns
* ⚠️ Unverified or abandoned creator accounts

## Advanced Features

### Slippage Control

Adjust slippage tolerance based on:

* **Low liquidity tokens**: 3-10% slippage
* **High liquidity tokens**: 0.5-2% slippage
* **Large trades**: Increase slippage tolerance

### Price Impact

Preview shows estimated price impact:

* **< 1%**: Minimal impact, good execution
* **1-5%**: Moderate impact, acceptable
* **> 5%**: High impact, consider splitting trade

## Trading During Key Events

* First few minutes are most volatile
