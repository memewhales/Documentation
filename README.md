## What is Yoink?

Yoink transforms creator content into tradable assets. Each token on Yoink is linked to a real creator or piece of content, letting traders speculate on virality while creators earn from every trade through **automated fee-sharing**.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Creator-First Platform**: Every token on Yoink is tied to a real creator. When traders buy and sell, creators earn directly from trading fees. Any creator can verify ownership and claim their earnings at any time. Our goal is to build a **sustainable ecosystem** where creators thrive alongside their communities, with fair and healthy trading conditions.

## Key Features

### 🔄 Automatic Buybacks

Each token is backed by an automated treasury that accumulates a percentage of trading fees. When the price drops below the EMA (Exponential Moving Average), the system automatically buys back the token — maintaining a **dynamic price floor** and market stability for every single deployed token.

### 🐦 Early Bird Bonus

A first-of-its-kind mechanic that rewards **early holders**. The Early Bird pool collects a portion of trading volume and distributes it among the **first 20 buyers** who haven’t sold. If an Early Bird sells, their seat is forfeited, and rewards are redistributed among the remaining holders — ensuring that true believers and long-term supporters are rewarded for staying in.


### 💎 Creator Rewards

Creators can verify their identity by submitting a request directly from their profile, then **claim trading fee rewards** from tokens linked to their content. Yoink ensures that creators **share in the economic upside** of their own virality.


### 🔥 Yoink Token Flywheel

As Yoink expands across social platforms, a percentage of all trading fees will be used to **buy back and burn** the $YOINK token — continuously capturing value from viral content and reinforcing the ecosystem’s **deflationary flywheel**.
