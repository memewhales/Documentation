## Key Features

### 🔄 Automatic Buybacks

Each token has buybacks enabled. A treasury accumulates a percentage of trading fees and automatically buys back the token when the price drops below EMA (Exponential Moving Average), creating a price floor.

### 🐦 Early Bird Bonus

A first-of-its-kind mechanic to reward early HOLDERS. The Early Bird pool collects a percentage of trading volume to distribute among Early Birds who haven't sold. **20 seats available** to the first 20 buyers. If an Early Bird sells, they forfeit their seat and rewards are split among remaining holders.

### 💎 Creator Rewards

Creators can login to Yoink, link their socials to verify ownership, and claim their rewards from trading fees. The platform ensures creators directly benefit from speculation on their content.

### 🔥 Yoink Token Flywheel

The Yoink platform will eventually capture the value of every piece of viral content across the internet. A percentage of trading fees will be used to buyback and burn the Yoink token in perpetuity, creating deflationary pressure.
