# Fee Structure

Yoink uses a transparent, fair fee system that benefits all participants in the ecosystem: the platform, creators, early supporters, and token holders.

## Total Transaction Fee

{% hint style="info" %}
### 4% fee on all buy and sell transactions

This single fee is automatically split among multiple parties to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem.

**Important:** All fees (except platform fee) are specific to each individual token and support that token's own ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## Fee Distribution Breakdown

Every transaction on Yoink incurs a **4% fee** that is distributed as follows:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Platform** | 1.0% | Platform operations & $YOINK buyback |
| **Creator** | 0.8% | Token creator earnings *(for this specific token)* |
| **Early Bird Pool** | 1.2% | Rewards for first 20 buyers *(of this token only)* |
| **Treasury** | 1.0% | Automatic buyback mechanism *(for this token only)* |

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Token-Specific Fees

**Creator Fee (0.8%)**, **Early Bird Pool (1.2%)**, and **Treasury (1%)** are all token-specific. 

When you trade Token ABC:
- Creator fee → Goes to Token ABC's creator
- Early Birds → Shared by Token ABC's first 20 buyers
- Treasury → Used to buyback and burn Token ABC

**Only the 1% platform fee is shared across the entire Yoink ecosystem.**
{% endhint %}

---

## Understanding Each Fee Component

### 1. Platform Fee (1%) 🏢

**Scope:** Platform-wide (not token-specific)

The 1% platform fee is further split 50-50:

* **0.5%** → Platform Treasury (operations, development, maintenance)
* **0.5%** → $YOINK Buyback Wallet (flywheel mechanism)

{% hint style="success" %}
**💡 Flywheel Effect**

Half of all platform fees automatically buy back $YOINK tokens, creating constant buying pressure and value accrual for $YOINK holders.

{% endhint %}

### 2. Creator Fee (0.8%) 👤

**Scope:** Token-specific (goes to that token's creator)

* Goes directly to the token creator's wallet
* Same rate as pump.fun (we compensate via user pool)
* Continues even after token graduates to Raydium
* Incentivizes quality token creation and ongoing promotion

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** If you trade $DOGE token, the 0.8% creator fee goes to $DOGE's creator, not other token creators.

{% endhint %}

---

### 3. Early Bird Pool (1.2%) 🐦

**Scope:** Token-specific (only for that token's early birds)

* Shared among the **first 20 buyers** of each specific token
* Rewards early supporters and risk-takers
* Claimable after holding requirements are met
* Creates incentive for early discovery

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** If you're one of the first 20 buyers of $PEPE token, you earn from all future $PEPE trades. Other tokens' trades don't affect your earnings.

{% endhint %}

---

### 4. Treasury Pool (1%) 💰

**Scope:** Token-specific (buybacks only that token)

* Funds the automatic buyback mechanism **for that specific token**
* Used to buy and burn tokens when price drops below EMA
* Grows with that token's trading volume
* Creates price support specific to that token

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** When you trade $CAT token, the 1% treasury fee builds $CAT's buyback fund. This fund only buys and burns $CAT tokens, not other tokens.

## Fee Examples

### Example 1: 10 SOL Buy Transaction on $DOGE Token

```
Total Fee: 0.4 SOL (4%)

Distribution:
├─ Platform: 0.1 SOL (1%) → Platform-wide
│  ├─ Platform Treasury: 0.05 SOL (0.5%)
│  └─ $YOINK Buyback: 0.05 SOL (0.5%)
│
├─ Creator: 0.08 SOL (0.8%) → $DOGE creator only
├─ Early Bird Pool: 0.12 SOL (1.2%) → $DOGE first 20 buyers
└─ Treasury (Buyback): 0.1 SOL (1%) → Buys & burns $DOGE only
```

### Example 2: 100 SOL Sell Transaction on $PEPE Token

```
Total Fee: 4 SOL (4%)

Distribution:
├─ Platform: 1 SOL (1%) → Platform-wide
│  ├─ Platform Treasury: 0.5 SOL (0.5%)
│  └─ $YOINK Buyback: 0.5 SOL (0.5%)
│
├─ Creator: 0.8 SOL (0.8%) → $PEPE creator only
├─ Early Bird Pool: 1.2 SOL (1.2%) → $PEPE first 20 buyers
└─ Treasury (Buyback): 1 SOL (1%) → Buys & burns $PEPE only
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Key Takeaway:**

3% of every transaction (Creator + Early Birds + Treasury) stays within that token's ecosystem.

Only 1% goes to the platform, and half of that (0.5%) buys back $YOINK.

## Volume = Fees = Ecosystem Growth

The fee system creates a positive feedback loop **for each token's ecosystem:**

```
More Trading Volume (on Token X)
        ↓
More Fees Generated
        ↓
├─ Larger Creator Earnings (Token X creator)
├─ Larger Early Bird Pool (Token X early birds)
├─ Larger Buyback Treasury (Token X support)
└─ More $YOINK Buybacks (platform-wide)
        ↓
Stronger Token X Ecosystem
        ↓
More Confident Traders
        ↓
More Trading Volume
        ↓
(cycle continues)
```

## $YOINK Buyback Flywheel

{% hint style="success" %}
**🔄 Platform Fees Power $YOINK Growth**

**50% of all platform fees are used to buyback $YOINK tokens**, creating constant buying pressure regardless of individual token performance.

**How it works:**
1. Every transaction generates 1% platform fee
2. 0.5% (half) goes directly to $YOINK buyback wallet
3. Buyback wallet automatically purchases $YOINK from market
4. Creates perpetual buying pressure for $YOINK token
5. More platform volume = more $YOINK buybacks

**Example:**
- $1M daily platform volume → $10,000 in platform fees → $5,000 buys $YOINK
- $10M daily platform volume → $100,000 in platform fees → $50,000 buys $YOINK

This percentage can increase as the platform establishes stronger backing infrastructure and achieves sustainable profitability.
{% endhint %}

### Why This Matters for $YOINK Holders

* **Volume Alignment**: Your $YOINK value grows with total platform success, not just individual tokens
* **Consistent Demand**: Constant buyback regardless of market conditions
* **Scalable**: More users = more volume = more buybacks
* **Transparent**: All buyback transactions visible on-chain
* **Sustainable**: Grows naturally with platform adoption

## FAQs

### Are fees the same for buys and sells?

Yes, both buy and sell transactions incur the same 4% fee with identical distribution.

### Can fees change in the future?

Fees are set in the smart contract at token creation. Each token's fee structure is permanent and cannot be changed.

### Do I pay fees when claiming early bird rewards?

No, claiming rewards does not incur trading fees. You only pay standard Solana network fees (gas).

### What happens to creator fees if creator abandons token?

Creator fees continue accumulating in the creator wallet. They can claim anytime, even years later.

### How is the $YOINK buyback executed?

The 0.5% platform fee accumulates in a dedicated wallet, which automatically purchases $YOINK from the market at regular intervals.

### Can I see where my fees went?

Yes! Every fee transaction is on-chain. You can track exactly where each portion went by viewing the transaction on Solana Explorer.

### Are there any additional hidden fees?

No. The 4% transaction fee is the only fee. You also pay standard Solana network fees (usually < $0.01), but those go to Solana validators, not Yoink.

### Why is Yoink's creator fee lower than pump.fun?

We compensate by allocating more to the early bird pool, which benefits the community and incentivizes early discovery and support.
