# 📈 How to Trade

Trading creator tokens on Yoink is simple, but understanding the core concepts will help you make better decisions and maximize your returns.

## What Are Creator Tokens?

Creator tokens represent real creators and their communities. When you buy a creator token, you're betting on that creator's growth, content quality, and community engagement. Every trade generates fees that benefit both creators and Early Bird holders.

## The Bonding Curve Journey

Every new token starts on a **bonding curve** - a mathematical formula that determines the price based on how many tokens have been sold:

* **Early buyers** get lower prices
* **Price increases** automatically as more people buy
* **Progress bar** shows how close the token is to "graduation"

## What Happens at 100% Progress?

When the progress reaches 100%, the token **graduates** to Raydium DEX. This is a major milestone because:

* **Liquidity is locked** permanently on Raydium
* **Trading volume** typically increases significantly  
* **Price discovery** becomes more mature
* **Token becomes** part of the broader Solana ecosystem

Graduation is generally positive for token holders as it provides permanent liquidity and wider market access.

## Early Bird Rewards

The first 20 buyers of any token become **Early Birds** and receive ongoing benefits:

* **Fee sharing** from all trades on that token
* **Exclusive status** that can't be bought later
* **Passive income** as long as you hold your tokens

Once you sell your tokens, you lose Early Bird status forever.

## Trading Essentials

### Slippage Control

**Slippage** is the difference between expected and actual trade prices. You can adjust this based on:

* **Small trades**: 1-3% slippage usually works
* **Large trades**: May need 5-10% slippage  
* **Low liquidity tokens**: Higher slippage required
* **High volume periods**: Lower slippage possible

### Price Impact

Before confirming trades, you'll see the **price impact** - how much your trade will move the token price. Generally:

* **Under 2%**: Good trade size
* **2-5%**: Moderate impact, still acceptable
* **Over 5%**: Large impact, consider splitting the trade

### Market Cap Understanding

**Market cap** shows the total value of all tokens. This helps you understand:

* **Small market cap**: Higher growth potential, higher risk
* **Large market cap**: More established, typically less volatile
* **Growth trajectory**: Compare with similar creators

## Trading Psychology

### When to Buy

Consider buying when:

* You believe in the creator's long-term potential
* The token has healthy trading volume
* You can secure an Early Bird spot
* The community is active and growing

### When to Sell

Consider selling when:

* Your investment goals are met
* The creator becomes inactive
* Better opportunities arise
* You need to manage risk

Remember: Selling means losing Early Bird status forever if you have it.

## Risk Management

* **Start small** until you understand the platform
* **Never invest** more than you can afford to lose
* **Diversify** across multiple tokens
* **Research creators** before investing
* **Monitor** your positions regularly

## Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Progress %** | Shows how close to graduation |
| **24h Volume** | Indicates trading activity |
| **Holder Count** | Shows community size |
| **Early Bird Spots** | Available reward positions |
| **Creator Activity** | Streaming schedule and engagement |

## Common Concepts

### Buybacks

Automatic buybacks create price floors and reduce supply, generally supporting token prices over time.

### Burn Mechanism

When buybacks happen, tokens are permanently removed from circulation, making remaining tokens potentially more valuable.

### Real-time Updates

Prices and charts update in real-time, so you always see current market conditions.

## Getting Started

The best way to learn is to start small and experiment with different tokens. Focus on creators you know and understand, and remember that trading is about patience and research, not quick profits.
