## Verification Status

{% hint style="warning" %}
**🚨 Important: Profile Verification Process**

**Anyone can submit** a profile verification for any streamer, but **only the Yoink team** can approve verifications.

**Submitted vs. Verified Profiles:**
- **Submitted Profile** → Someone created a profile for a streamer, but this doesn't mean the real creator is on the platform. We're just representing them based on public information.
- **Verified Profile** → The Yoink team has manually checked and received proof that the streamer is actually on the platform and the profile belongs to them.

**What verification means:**
- ✅ Real streamer confirmed their presence on Yoink
- ✅ Identity verified by Yoink team
- ✅ Profile ownership authenticated
- ✅ Safe to interact with and support

Always look for the verification badge before assuming a streamer is actively using Yoink!
