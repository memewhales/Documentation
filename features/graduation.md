# What is Graduation

## Overview

Graduation is the process where a token successfully completes its bonding curve phase and transitions to a decentralized exchange (DEX) with permanent liquidity on Raydium.

## How Graduation Works

### The Bonding Curve

When a coin is first created on Yoink, it starts with a bonding curve mechanism:

* **Initial Phase**: The token trades on an internal bonding curve
* **Liquidity Building**: As users trade, liquidity accumulates
* **Progress Tracking**: You can see the graduation progress on each coin's page

### Reaching 100%

The graduation happens when the bonding curve reaches **100% completion**:

1. **Trading Activity**: Users buy and sell the token, gradually filling the curve
2. **Liquidity Accumulation**: Trading fees and volume build up the liquidity pool
3. **Automatic Graduation**: Once 100% is reached, the migration happens automatically

## The Migration Process

When a token graduates:

### ✅ Automatic Steps

1. **Bonding Curve Closes**: No more trades on the internal curve
2. **Liquidity Migration**: All accumulated liquidity is sent to Raydium
3. **LP Creation**: A permanent liquidity pool is created on Raydium
4. **Trading Resumes**: Token becomes freely tradeable on Raydium DEX

### 🎯 What This Means

* **Permanent Liquidity**: The token now has stable, permanent liquidity
* **DEX Trading**: Anyone can trade on Raydium directly
* **Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing on a major DEX
* **Increased Exposure**: Listed on Raydium alongside major tokens
